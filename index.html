      <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Beck, born Bek David Campbell, is an American musician who has been producing music since his debut album, "Mellow Gold", released in 1993. His catalog covers a 
            huge swath of genres from alternative, folk, big band, and hip hop to name a few, and he continues to expand his musical range. Beck was finally acknowledged 
            for his musical prowess when he won Album of the year at the 2015 Grammy Award for his album, "Morning Phase". Winning this award didn't slow down Beck in the slightest.
            He since released the pop inspired album, "Colors", which won 2 more Grammys, and has his 14th album is due to be released later this year. </p>
        </p>
        <p>Besides being the vocalist, writer, and producer on all of his albums Beck also plays an insane amount of instruments. From traditional instruments like the guitar, 
            drums, keyboard to more obscure entries like sitar, banjo, and glokenspiel, Beck brings something new to every album. He also collaborates with other talented musicians.
            He has played with artists such as The Flaming Lips, Jack White, and Lady Gaga, each adding to the diversity of Beck's sound.
