    <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Beck, who's real name is Bek David Campbell, was born on July 8th, 1970. 
            Beck's musical career became widespread in 1994 when he released the single "loser"
            from his debut studio album, Mellow Gold. Since then Beck has released 12 more albums covering a wide 
            variety of musical styles including pop, funk, soul, folk, rock, and alternative to name 
            a few. His 2014 album, Morning Phase, took home album of the year at the 2015 Grammy Awards.

            Beck's life hasn't been without controversy. In 2005 he admitted to being a member of The Church of Scientology. 
            This sparked backlash from some fans as more and more reports of threats, conspiracy, medical neglect, and other 
            crimes came out against the Scientoligists. In the years since his admitted involvement in the church the backlash 
            seemed to dissapear and he is regarded only for his musical contributions.
